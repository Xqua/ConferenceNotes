# Topic
**Cells from the immune system generate neurons in the brain**

# Notes
* Work on adult neurogenesis in crustacean
* Adult neurogen has been pretty well documented in crustacean
* BrDU Tracking of cells.
  * See 2 main clusters of cells in the CNS.
* The two main proliferation zone are connected by a pathway
  * The track is labeled by Glutamine Syntethase.
* What is the stem cell that give rise to the neurogenesis
* Probably neuroblasts that were documented in other insect species.
* If those are the stem cells, then the self renewing divisions should be marked by BrDU.
  * Double marked cells BrDU first then Edu.
  * All BrDU cells have left the niche
  * Thus the migration is away from the niche,
  * And the divisions at the niche are not self renewing.
* Some facts:
  * Stable number of cells in the niche (300 ish, grows with animal size)
  * Niche cells divide (1/day) and both daughter migrate away
  * Neurogenesis continues throughout the long lives of the crayfish (15-20 years)
* Then the question becomes, where does those cell come from ?
* Did a pulse BrDU and looked for cells being tagged in the niche.
  * What you see is that after the first peak (neurogenic niche division) you have a second peak at 8 days (8-14 days distribution).
  * The late arriving cells must thus have been labeled in the source tissue.
  * In vitro the only cells that showed affinity for the CNS, where blood cells from the Hemolymph.
  * Labeled blood cells ex vivo and reinjected them in an animal.
  * Found that they travel to the niche via the circulation, and become neuron stem cells and then neurons.
* **Thus neurons form adult neurogenesis seem to emerge from the hematopoietic lineage.**
* Goes along with the recent data on mammals that show very limited self renewing capacity of neural stem cells.
  * And potential link with the hematopoietic lineage

wild paper: [Eva Mezey, Barabara Crain 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12538864) Found that bone marrow transplant give rise to neurons in humans.
