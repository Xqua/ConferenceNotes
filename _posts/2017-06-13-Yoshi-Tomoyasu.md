# Topic
**Evolution of wings**

# Notes
* The evolution of wings in mammal and reptiles, is known it is limbs / hands that evolved.
* But for insects the question is much different, the wing does not seem to come from a limb
* Two theory of wing Evolution
  * Paranotal Lobes: Comes from an extension of the dorsal tissue (exoskelton?)
    Pro: Explain the dorsal part
    Con: Does not explain the muscle attachement and articulation
  * Gills extension: Extension of gills explains the muscle attachement and articulation but not the dorsal part.
* KO of Vestigial gene (controls the wing formation) in Tribolium shows that the T1 segment is also affected (non wing segment). The effect are on both area that are though to be the origin of wings.
* Claims that both tissue (gill and paranodal) merged to give rise to the wing
* But are the observation Tribolium specific ?
  * Thus go study crustacean to see the ancestral state.
* Vestigial in paryhale is expressed along the edges of the tergal plates and coxal PLates
  * KO of Vg shows reduction and reshaping of the two plates.
* Check other genes
  * apA: mostly expressed at the attachement of the Costal plate on the tergal plate. Also high in Gill to Cp attachement
  * nub: Comoplex expression, with global expression in the gill and mostly at the margin. KO-> No gills and reduced plates.
* Conclusion is weird: Two gene network crosswiring ?
