# Topic
**Neural circuits in fly larva**


# Notes

* Connectomics of the larval brain
* Devised mapping algorithm and elastic registration is best
* But then needed to annotate the brain
  * Made tools for community based annotation
  * Created a synergy by inviting a student of each lab studying larba brain to map 
  * Succeeded at mapping it that way.
* Showed that the brain is symetrical on the R/L axis
