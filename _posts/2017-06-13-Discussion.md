# Topic
**Discuss the bioinformatics ressources and genomes**


# Discussion

* Dovetails would cost 15K (Chicago + Hi-C) (require Scaffold N50 > 20k)
* Chicago method allows for missjoints of contig correction
* Does not allow to assemble repeats
* Someone did PacBio -> 2-3 Mb contigs in Droso or cow
* Lots of polymorphism in non metazoan genes -> Could be problematic to map back
* Pop Gen interest due to polymorphism
* Infrastructure for genome
  * hosted on I5k for now (and forever prob)
* Serie of Webinars on Youtube
