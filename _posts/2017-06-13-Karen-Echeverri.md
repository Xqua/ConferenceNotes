# Topic
**Regeneration of Salamander Spinal Chord**

# Notes
* Salamander have great Regeneration. Can regenerate limbs.
* Humans are bad at it.
* you can chop Axolotl BRAIN and it will regenerate O.o
* Focus on the Regeneration of spinal chord.
  * When their is a lesion in the Spinal Chord, there is a scar forming with glial cells and it prevents the extension of the axons.
  * in Newt and Axolotl if you cut the spinal chord it will grow back fuse and axons elongate.
* Developed a crushing device for spinal chord injury in Axolotl.
  * Similar to what was showed before you can see that the spinal chord regenerate.
  * When you crush the spinal chord, both part on each side survive and the axons survive
  * It seems then that the axon elongates in the same track as the old axon.
* Cells that regenerate migrate from the Ant and Post sites, 500um and 350um respectively.
* Can prevent regeneration to happen by stopping cell proliferation
* Can prevent regeneration by  maintaining axon depolarization.
* Found that C-FOS is over activated for 1 day post injury.
* But C-FOS is normally activating GFAP, but dimer TF, and can instead down-regulate GFAP pathway.
  * GFAP pathway is responsible for glial scars
* Found one miRNA (miR-200a) that is upreg
* If KO miR-200a no regeneration
  * Hypothesis: miR-200a regulate c-Jun (co-dimer of C-FOS)
* The  main model is thus as follow
  * injury -> Up-regulate C0fos/JunB and miR-200a -> miR-200a down-regulate C-jun -> Prevent GFAP -> Prevent scarification
