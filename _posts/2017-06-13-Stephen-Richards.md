# Topic
**What's new in Crustacean genomics, i5k**

# Notes
* The i5K why to do a Pilot (50 organisms)
  * but endedup being a bit less than 30
  * Decided to sequence organisms from different orders (strategic for publications and for evolution analysis)
* Using WebApollo for genome Browsing
* about 60 genomes on the i5K workspace
* Important to all come together because the per specie database is a bad idea !
* >500 colaborators to annotate genomes.
* Spiders have a duplication in the Hox cluster (prior to Scorpion / spider divergence)
* history of chemosensing genes
  * They don't appear before you get to the insects.
  * Even more accurately they only appear when you get to fly
  * Hypothesis: when you fly you need to smell much more different stuff
* Trees for protein family have been done using OrthoDB
  * I5K is hosting an arthropod OrthoDB
* Analysed the gene family changes in orders.
* Crustacean tree is probably wrong. and they are working on it.
* Evolution of gene family is in many different functions but mostly in chemotaxy or related to sensory, metabolism and digestion.
* Lepidoptera has an explosion of gene family (as defined by OrthoDB blast methodology aka in silico inferred.)
* Can look at GC content to study Methylation (CpG islands ! smart !)
* Redundans is a tool that works to assemble bad K-mer genomes.
