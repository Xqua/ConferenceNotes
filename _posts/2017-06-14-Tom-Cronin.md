* Complex behavior
* eyes are tripartite
  * 2 fields looking at the same location (dual eye vision in one eye)
  * 1 field is for polarized and other light analysis such as color.
* a lot of Opsins in their eyes, 35+ Opsins
* and 10 receptors ... more opsin than receptors !
* there is many opsin in each cell (confirmed by in situ) and it varies, some 2 opsin some 5
* UV system is reversed, only 2 pigments and they are on a 1 per cell system.
* Located in the crystal of the cones.
