# Topic
**Neural circuits in fly larva**


# Notes

* Wood is a great food source if you can break it down (Cellullose = Glucose)
* HemiCellulose is branching polymere
* Lignin is really hard to break down (much more complex molecule)
* Model Limnoria and Chelura


**Vaaje-Kolstad 2010 for Chitin Structures.**


# Question

* Have you looked at the efficiency of wood digestion ?
