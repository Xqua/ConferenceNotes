# Topic
**organ morphogenesis**

# Notes
* Interested in tissue growth, how do organ know when to stop growing.
* Focusing on insects and parhyale to study homologous organ formations.
* Paryhale is interesting for limb development because the body plan offers 19 limbs types.
* Genetic modifications are very efficient (60% and up)
  * Can inject at the 2 cell stage that allows for Mosaic Left Right controls.
* Light Sheet imaging of the NLS-dsRed line.
  * Slow developing embryos (10 days total)
  * Imaged Parhyale for 5 days
  * Gets at single cell resolution.
  * Can track the cells
* Helped with the development of Mamut
* Is their compartments in the development of the limbs
  * Indeed showed that the cells do not mix with other cells.
  * The a b c d rows give rise to cells that do not mix
  * the b cells become ventral cells.
* Is the proliferation homogeneous
  * No, there is a central compartments that divides much faster.
  * there are clear organized location with different growth rate
  * This agrees with the model that to build 3D structure in morphogenesis you can modulate the growth rate locally and thus with time end up with precise define 3D shapes.
* Are the divisions oriented ?
  * During the development of the limb the cells switch from dividing orthogonally to the direction of the limb to parallel to the limb.
* There is very little mixing from the germ band until the limb formed.
* The order the cells are organized at during germ band is preserved during the limb formation and the most distal cells at the end was the most distal cells at the beginning
* Showed that the cells that will become dorsal express Dpp
* DistalLess (Dll) CrispR Knock-in/out
  * Used the mosaic KO to study the embryo
