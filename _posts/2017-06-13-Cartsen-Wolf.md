# Topic
**Germband formation in malacostrean**

# Notes
* Richter and Scholtz 2001 (For a tree of crustacean)
* Wolfgang Dohle (1970 72 76) showed the divisions of EctoTeloblast into a row, that then undergoes 2 more divisionn to reach a 4 cell pattern.
* Amphipods do not have the EctoTeloblast (Sholtz 1996)
* Genenaloy of the cells does not correlate with the segments
  * Instead, the segments goes from the b cell row to the b cell row, thus a gets assigned another segment.
* Has done single cell tracing (FM4-64) by injecting one cells of the rows at germ band and waiting.
  * Traced the pattern in limb formation (Wolf 2008)
  * Other people have show Neuron formation
* 2 types of cell form rows
  * Ecto Teloblast
  * Meso Teloblast
  * The type depends on Which lineage contributes to the formation of the rows.
* Amphipods have a completly different gastrulation
