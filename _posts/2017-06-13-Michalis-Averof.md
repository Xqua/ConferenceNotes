# Topic
**Limb regeneration in Paryhale hawaiensis**

# Notes
* regeneration happens in many clades
* Parhyale regenerate limbs.
* Sequence of regeneration is :
  * 1 day Scabbing reaction, wound closure glial cells.
  * 2-3 day Blastema formation, ectoderm cells form a semi sphere epidermis that closes over the wound (inside the scab)
  * 3-5 day Cell proliferation and patterning of the epidermis.
  * moult (much later no days) muscles regenerate
* Looking for the lineage that would create the progenitor cells
  * There is some degree of commitment, at least to mesoderm VS ecotderm
    * Found by injecting blastomeres and tracking which cells participate in the regeneration and where.
  * Found satellite like cells that seem to be the progenitor that regenerate muscles.
    * small cells, associated with muscle.
  * Confirmed by injection of those cells into non labeled animal
* If this cell type is the same satellite cell type between mammals and paryhale then **Satellite cells emerged at the base of bilaterian evolution**.
* Cell tracking and lineage tracking of regeneration
* every epidermal cells is making a small contribution to the new limb (aka there is no one cell that proliferate more than others.)
* The position of the cells in the blastema is globally maintained in the limb.
* Thus the signaling is probably already present then.
