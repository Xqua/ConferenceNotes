# Topic
**Olphactory system in crustaceans**


# Notes

* Work on Hermit crabs
* Olphactory lobes is organismed in collumns.
* too complex in Hermit crabs
* Thus try to study it in Paryhale
* Used GPS on Chrismas Island
  * Studied movement of crabs
* Showed that terestrial crustacean (at least 1 specie) can smell
* Did a bunch of neuro anatomy
