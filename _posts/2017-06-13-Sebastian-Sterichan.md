# Topic
**Tissue flows ini morphogenesis**

# Notes
* Using lightsheet microscopy to study morphogenesis
* Take 3D images and map it back with a projection on a plane
* Use the plane as a basis for algorithm
* Map back to the 3D and do force and physics measures
* Integrate Mechanical Stress and how it drives the flow in gastrulation of Dmel.
