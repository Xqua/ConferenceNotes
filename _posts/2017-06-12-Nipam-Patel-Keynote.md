# Notes

* Patel starts with his accidental discovery of Engrail cross reactive antibody
* Then goes into CrayFish Germ Band that is organized into rows.
* Got into crustacean because of the beautiful rows
* Then went ot island did some work on Ubx
* But needed a specie to work on -> Parhyale Hawaiensis
* Goes into introducing Parhyale
  * Same story
* Gram band stage
  * Cells are Square ? O.o !
  * clones seems to be ending up at random positions.
* Ectoderm
  * Anterior posterior waves of divisions
  * **Single Cell sequencing**
    * of S11 LOOK for potential a/b c/d a b c d cells**
    * Look for Pair rule genes Gap genes etc (pax Eve runt etc)
* Look back at Nipam papers of the germ band segmentation
* Quickly mention the Hox system but moves on
* Goes into the regeneration story.
  * Ablate ml mav etc
* Goes into g regeneration
  * maternal beta cathenin is a marker of Parhyale "germ plasm" that's segregated into g
  * lineage traced with minos transgenesis of the g lineage
  * after 2-4 wekks post hatching VASA staining reappears
  * delay in reproduction
  * Which cell give rise to the regenerated germ lineage
  * ablate g inject ml / mr
    * ml mr give rise to the g lineage (looks like it's not 100%)
  * Dpp and Delta are key component for regeneration
  * seems to have a Vasa driver construct
  * **No mention of Cassandra's work at all**
